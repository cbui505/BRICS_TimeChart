<title>BRICS: GDP, HDI, and population</title>

<h1>BRICS - GDP, HDI, and population trends from 1970-2050</h1>
<p>In the mid-19th century, Russia dominated both GDP and HDI when compared to the other BRICS countries. However, BRICS countries have been rapidly catching up
   to Russia ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990. It is projected that in the years leading up to 2050, all of the BRICS countries will be able to
    compete with, and even overtake the former champion in terms of GDP and HDI.
